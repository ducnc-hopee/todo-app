# Coding conventions

**The purpose of the coding convention is to share the minimum awareness of coding within the team and to improve the quality of the entire system.**

What is written here is not fixed, but rather we plan to update it more and more if there are good rules that should be unified.\
Basically, the policy is " **If the rules are bad, improve them** ", but it's bad manners to ignore the rules and implement whatever you want, so be careful.\
Another point of view for code reviews is whether they comply with these rules.

- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
- KISS (Keep it simple)
